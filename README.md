# LawLink MVP ‚öñÔ∏è

> An AI-powered legal consultation platform specializing in labour law.

LawLink is an AI chatbot designed to provide initial legal guidance for labour law inquiries. This project serves as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a legal tech startup, leveraging a modern web stack to make legal information more accessible.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
-   **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
-   **Monorepo Tools:** `npm` scripts with `concurrently`

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized as a monorepo to streamline development between the client and server.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   JDK (v17 or higher recommended)
-   Maven or Gradle (for backend dependency management)

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/davidfoo07/legal-tech-ai.git
    cd legal-tech-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run `npm install` from the root directory. This will install the necessary packages for running both the frontend and backend concurrently, as well as install dependencies for the `frontend` workspace.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    _(Note: You will still need to ensure your backend dependencies are resolved by your Java IDE or build tool.)_

### 3. Environment Configuration

The project requires environment variables for both the frontend and backend to function correctly. Sample files are provided.

1.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `/frontend` directory, copy the example file, and create your local environment file.

    ```sh
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.development
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Similarly, create the environment file for the Spring Boot server in the `/backend` directory.

    ```sh
    cp backend/src/main/resources/application.example.properties backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties
    ```

3.  **Update Environment Variables:**
    Open the newly created `.env.development` (frontend) and `application-dev.properties` (backend) files and fill in the required values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

## üíª Running the Application

You can start both the backend API and the frontend development server with a single command from the **root directory**.

```sh
npm run dev
```
