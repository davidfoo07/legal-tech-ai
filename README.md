## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   JDK (v17 or higher recommended)
-   Maven or Gradle (for backend dependency management)

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/davidfoo07/legal-tech-ai.git
    cd legal-tech-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run `npm install` from the root directory. This will install the necessary packages for running both the frontend and backend concurrently, as well as install dependencies for the `frontend` workspace.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    _(Note: You will still need to ensure your backend dependencies are resolved by your Java IDE or build tool.)_

### 3. Environment Configuration

The project requires environment variables for both the frontend and backend to function correctly. Sample files are provided.

1.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `/frontend` directory, copy the example file, and create your local environment file.

    ```sh
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.development
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Similarly, create the environment file for the Spring Boot server in the `/backend` directory.

    ```sh
    cp backend/src/main/resources/application.example.properties backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties
    ```

3.  **Update Environment Variables:**
    Open the newly created `.env.development` (frontend) and `application-dev.properties` (backend) files and fill in the required values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

## üíª Running the Application

You can start both the backend API and the frontend development server with a single command from the **root directory**.

```sh
npm run dev
```
